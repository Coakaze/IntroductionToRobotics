# IntroductionToRobotics
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.


## Homework 1
Task: Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of thecolor of the RGB led (Red,Green andBlue).  The control must be donewithdigital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiome-ter with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connectedto the led.

## Homework 2
Task: Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk. You will use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green) and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green).

## Homework 3
Task: Should detect EMF (check body and near outlets.  DO NOT IN-SERT INTO OUTLET - AKA NU-L BAGATI IN PRIZA). It should print the value on the 7-segment display (or light the led bar)and should makea sound based on the intensity.

## Homework 4
Task: First  state:   you  can  use  a  joystick  axis  to  cycle  through  the  4 digits; using the other axis does nothing.  A blinking decimal point showsthe current digit position.  When pressing the button (must use interruptfor  maximum  points!),  you  lock  in  on  the  selected  digit  and  enter  thesecond state.  In this state, the decimal point stays always on, no longerblinking and you can no longer use the axis to cycle through the 4 digits.Instead, using the other axis, you can increment on decrement the numberon the current digit.  Pressing the button again returns you to the previousstate.  For bonus, save the last value in eeprom and load it when startingarduino.  Also, keep in mind that when changing the number, you mustincrement it for each joystick movement - it should not work continuoslyincrement if you keep the joystick in one position.
