# IntroductionToRobotics
Introduction to Robotics laboratory homeworks, taken in the 3rd year at the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Bucharest. Each homework includes requirements, implementation details, code and image files.


## Homework 1
Task: Use a separat potentiometer in controlling each of thecolor of the RGB led (Red,Green andBlue).  The control must be donewithdigital electronics(aka you must read the value of the potentiome-ter with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connectedto the led.
